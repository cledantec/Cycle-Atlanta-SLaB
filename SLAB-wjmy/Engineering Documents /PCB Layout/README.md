xTwo versions of the PCB designs are in the &quot;PCB Layout&quot; Folder.

You may download Eagle CAD software from AutoCAD and open it from the software.

This PCB is to provide stable connection from the micro-controller to Lidars. Version 1.0 used PWM transmission; Version 2.0 used I2C communication protocol. It is believed that Version 2.0 can measure much more accurately. However, due to the shelter-in-place situation, the testing was not able to conduct.

Version 1.0 - The original version that was printed and tested.

Pros: 1) Compact; 2) Easy to manufacture

Cons: 1) Lower sampling rate; 2) Power issue; 3) Wiring harness

Version 2.0 - The improved version that was designed by WJMY. The PCB layout was validated by the Electronics lab at Georgia Tech Mechanical Engineering Department.

Pros: 1) Estimated run time: 6 hours; 2) Easy assembly and disassembly;

3) Faster sampling rate

Cons: 1) Relatively more difficult to manufacture.

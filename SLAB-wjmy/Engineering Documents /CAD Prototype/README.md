**Parts and Assemblies**

All files were designed in Solidworks.

The two custom files that are most important in the design are the **&quot;Box Bottom Half&quot;** and the **&quot;Box Top Half.&quot;** These parts start with the base prefabricated box from McMaster and are custom fit to the other components in the box.

The **&quot;Bike Mounted Assembly&quot;** shows the entire design as used for renderings. **&quot;Package Prototype V3.0&quot;** provides the package assembly by itself.

There are several grabcad stand-ins for the assembly design (to provide a CAD bike or phone mount, for example). These parts are not essential to the final design but are provided to model the final package.

Similarly, there are also many CAD files that represent parts from McMaster, including screws, nuts, and other linkages. These are provided, often modified slightly from their original CAD file to be used (e.g. separating **&quot;8896T103\_304 SS U-BOLT&quot;** part into **&quot;8896T103\_304 SS U-BOLT – BOLT ONLY&quot;** and **&quot;8896T103\_304 SS U-BOLT – NUT ONLY&quot;** )

**Drawings and Assembly Instructions**

Detailed part and assembly drawings are included in the **&quot;Fabrication Package.&quot;** These drawings show the exact dimensions of all features in the custom package to guide manufacturing. Additionally, the **&quot;Fabrication Package and Assembly Instructions&quot;** provides detailed step by step instructions in procuring, manufacturing, and assembling this package.

**Parts List**

The &quot; **Fabrication Package and Assembly Instructions&quot;** also begins with a detailed parts list that details every part included in this package and providing links to purchase them from McMaster.
